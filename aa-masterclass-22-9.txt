\date June 6, 2022

Much of this exercise was originally created by Alberto Pérez de Alba
Ortíz for the Cecam School "Understanding Molecular Simulation", held
annually in Amsterdam.

\section masterclass-22-9-aims Aims

The aim of this Masterclass is to demonstrate the advantages of path
collective variables for describing and simulating activated molecular
processes, and to provide hands-on experience with setting up,
running, and analyzing biased path-CV simulations, such as
path-metadynamics.

\section masterclass-22-9-lo Objectives

Once this Masterclass is completed, users will be able to:

 - Use the Plumed PesMD engine to run test simulations of enhanced sampling methods.
 - Write Plumed input files to run metadynamics and path-metadynamics simulations.
 - Tune the adaptive path-CV parameters for optimal efficiency.
 - Analyze the evolution and convergence of the transition path and the free energy profile.
 - Use the multiple walker parallelization of metadynamics and path-metadynamics.
 - Restart a PMD simulation from a previous guess path.

\section masterclass-22-9-pre Prerequisites

We assume that you are familiar with PLUMED. However, the 2021 PLUMED
Masterclass is a great place to start if you are not.

\section masterclass-22-9-install Setting up the software 

The data needed to complete the exercises of this Masterclass can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Ensing-Laboratory/masterclass-22-09).
You can clone this repository locally on your machine using the following command:

\verbatim
git clone https://github.com/Ensing-Laboratory/masterclass-22-09
\endverbatim

We will use Plumed version 2.3.0 for this exercise together with personal
versions of the PathCV and PESMD features. With the above `git clone`
command, you have already downloaded them, and with the following
commands we compile this version of plumed:

\verbatim
cd masterclass-22-09/plumed
chmod +x install
./install
\endverbatim

This takes about 5-10 minutes on a modern laptop or desktop
computer. After that, the plumed executable is installed in the folder
`masterclass-22-09/plumed/bin`.

Information on these versions of the PathCV option and the PESMD
option may be slightly different from that in the latest online
plumed manual. Instead, open your local version in a browser, which
you can find in the following locations on your computer:

  - `masterclass-22-09/plumed/plumed-2.3.0/user-doc/html/index.html`
  - `masterclass-22-09/plumed/plumed-2.3.0/user-doc/html/pesmd.html`
  - `masterclass-22-09/plumed/plumed-2.3.0/user-doc/html/_p_a_t_h_c_v.html`

The exercises are found in the folder `masterclass-22-09/exercises`.


\subsection masterclass-22-9-intro Introduction

In this exercise, we will perform metadynamics [1] and path-metadynamics
(PMD) [2-4] simulations of a system that can undergo a
transition between two free energy minima. These two stable states are
separated by a transition state barrier, so that the transition
process is a _rare event_ for ``normal'' (i.e. unbiased) molecular dynamics
simulations.

PMD is able to simultaneously and efficiently converge the transition
path (which can be either an average transition path or a minimum free
energy path (MFEP)) and the free energy profile of the process along
this path.  This is achieved by performing metadynamics on an adaptive
path connecting the two known stable states.

In order to understand the principles and advantages of PMD, we will
first perform standard metadynamics and get familiar with its
parameters and functionalities.  Subsequently, we will add the
features corresponding to the adaptive path.  To ease computation and
visualization, we will employ a simple model system.

This exercise makes use of PLUMED's [5] own internal engine: _plumed
pesmd_, i.e. without being coupled to an MD engine that runs an actual
molecular system. The advantages are that the simulations will be very
fast, and you do not need to know anything about the MD engine of our
choice, which might be different from the one that you are used to.

Still, the enhanced sampling techniques that you will use in this
exercise, and the plumed input files that we will write for that, can
also be used (with very little changes) with plumed patched to any MD
software, which means that you can potentially use it for your own
research!

In order to overcome the timescale limitations of MD and be able to
observe relevant molecular transitions, the community has developed a
plethora of enhanced sampling methods.  Among them, we can identify
the so-called biasing methods, which work by exerting an external
potential (or force) on a few key descriptive degrees of freedom of
the transition, commonly called _collective variables_
(CVs).

The choice and design of CVs is a task of great
importance.  In the following, we will assume that the CVs are known.
We will consider a molecular system whose free energy surface (FES) is
fully described by a set of \f$N\f$ CVs, \f$\{z_i(\mathbf{q}\,)\}\f$ with
\f$i=1... N\f$, which are all functions of the system's particle
positions \f$\mathbf{q}(t)\f$.  We will also assume that these particle
positions \f$\mathbf{q}(t)\f$ evolve in time with a canonical equilibrium
distribution at temperature \f$T\f$ under a potential
\f$V(\mathbf{q})\f$.

\subsection masterclass-22-9-metadyn Metadynamics 
We are interested in exploring the space spanned by the CVs, \f$\{z_i\}\f$, 
and in quantifying the free energy.
In order to do so, in metadynamics we exert a history-dependent repulsive potential
by summing Gaussian kernels over time:

\f[
V_\text{bias}(\mathbf{z},t) = \sum_{\kappa\tau<t} H(\kappa\tau) \exp \biggr( - \sum^{N}_{i=1} \frac{(z_i - z_i(q(\kappa\tau)))^2}{2 W_i^2} \biggr),
\f]


with Gaussian height \f$H\f$, widths along each CV \f$W_i\f$, and depositing frequency \f$\tau\f$. 
This bias drives the system away from already visited configurations
and into new regions of CV-space.
More importantly, in the long-time limit,
the bias potential converges to the minus free energy
as function of the CVs: \f$V_\text{bias}(\mathbf{z},t \rightarrow \infty) = - F(\mathbf{z})\f$.

As a well-established sampling technique, metadynamics also has
several extensions to accelerate convergence and improve computational
performance, such as the multiple-walker and well-tempered versions [6,7].

Metadynamics can handle a few CVs simultaneously in a trivial manner,
which spares us from having to find a single perfect CV.
Instead, an appropriate set of CVs allows us
to converge an insightful multidimensional free energy landscape,
in which (meta)stable states and connecting MFEPs can be identified.
In practice however, especially when investigating complex transitions,
the number of CVs is limited to \f$N\approx3\f$, because of the exponential
growth of computational cost with CV dimensionality.



\subsection masterclass-22-9-label1 Path-metadynamics

In order to tackle complex transitions that require many CVs,
path-based methods were developed.  In these schemes, a path-CV is
introduced.  That is, a parametrized curve that connects two FES
basins --- the known stable states \f$A\f$ and \f$B\f$ --- in the
space spanned by the CVs: \f$\mathbf{s}(\sigma): \mathbb{R}
\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^N\f$, where the parameter
\f$\sigma(\mathbf{z}\,) | _{s} : \mathbb{R}^N \rightarrow [0,1]\f$
yields the progress along the path from \f$A\f$ to \f$B\f$, such that
\f$\mathbf{s}(0) \in A\f$ and \f$\mathbf{s}(1) \in B\f$.

This progress parameter emulates the reaction coordinate and can
in principle be connected to the committor value.  Since the
transition path curve is not known a priori, the path-CV must be
adaptive.  If we assume that, in the vicinity of the path, the
iso-commitor planes \f$S_\sigma\f$ are perpendicular to
\f$\mathbf{s}(\sigma)\f$, and that the configurational probability is
a good indicator of the transition flux density, then we can converge
the average transition path by iteratively adapting a guess path to
the cumulative average density: \f$\mathbf{s}_g(\sigma_g) =
\langle\mathbf{z}\,\rangle _{\sigma_g}\f$ [3].

The key advantage of PMD is that the metadynamics biasing can be
performed on the 1D progress parameter along the adaptive path-CV,
instead of the \f$N\f$-dimensional CV-space.  PMD is able to converge
a path, and the free energy along it, with a sublinear rise in
computational cost with respect to the growth in CV dimensionality
(instead of the exponential relation when not using a path-CV)[4].

Numerically, the adaptive path-CV is implemented as a set of \f$M\f$
ordered nodes (coordinates in CV-space) \f$\mathbf{s}_g (\sigma_g,t)
\rightarrow {\mathbf{s}^{\,t_i}_j}\f$ with \f$j=1,...,M\f$, where
\f$t_i\f$ is the discrete time of path updates.  The projection of any
point \f$\mathbf{z}\f$ onto the path is done considering the closest
two nodes, and \f$\sigma\f$ is obtained by interpolation.  This
approach requires equidistant nodes, which are imposed by a
reparametrization step after each path update.  The update step for
the path nodes is done by:

\f[
\mathbf{s}_j^{\,t_{i+1}} = \mathbf{s}_j^{\,t_{i}} + \frac{ \sum_k^{} w_{k} \cdot ( \mathbf{z}_k - \mathbf{s}^{\,t_{i}} ( \sigma (\mathbf{z}_k) ) )} { \sum_k^{} \xi^{t_i - k} w_{j,k} }, \text{ with } \\
w_{k} = \max \biggr[ 0, \biggr( 1 - \frac{|| \mathbf{s}^{\,t_i}_j - \mathbf{s}^{\,t_i} (\sigma ( \mathbf{z}_k)) ||}{|| \mathbf{s}^{\,t_i}_j - \mathbf{s}^{\,t_i}_{j+1} ||} \biggr) \biggr],
\f]


where \f$k\f$ is the current MD step and \f$w\f$ is the weight of the
adjustment, which is non-zero only for the two nodes closest to the
average CV density.  We also introduce the fade factor \f$\xi =\exp(
-\ln(2) / \tau_{1/2})\f$, with \f$\tau_{1/2}\f$ as a half-life: the
number of MD steps after which the distances measured from the path
weight only 50\% of its original value.  A short half-life increases
path flexibility by allowing it to rapidly ``forget'' a bad initial
guess, while a long half-life restricts the path fluctuations and
leads eventually to optimal convergence.  The first and last nodes,
located at the stable states \f$A\f$ and \f$B\f$ respectively, remain
fixed.  Extra trailing nodes can be placed at both ends of the path to
better capture the free energy valleys.  Wall potentials can be used
to keep the sampling near the relevant [0,1] \f$\sigma\f$-interval.
 
Additionally, a harmonic restraint set on \f$|| \mathbf{z}_k -
\mathbf{s}^{\,t_{i}} ( \sigma (\mathbf{z}_k) ) ||\f$ can help in
converging to a specific transition path in scenarios with multiple or
ill-defined transition channels.  We refer to this restraint as a
``tube'' potential.  In the limit of an infinitesimally narrow tube
potential, the path update step follows the local free energy gradient
and PMD converges to the MFEP instead of the average transition path.
This control over the behavior of the algorithm is an advantageous
feature, as switching from a density-driven to a gradient-driven path
optimization leads either to the average transition path or the MFEP.
 
Metadynamics, the method of choice to sample the path-CV, drives the
system back and forth along the path, providing sufficient sampling of
the CV density to localize the transition path. At the same time,
metadynamics continuously self-corrects the free energy by overwriting
the previously deposited Gaussians with new ones. This leads to a
converged free energy along the localized path:
\f$V_\text{bias}(\sigma,t \rightarrow \infty) = -F(\sigma)\f$.  Most
of the algorithmic extensions developed for metadynamics
(well-tempered, transition-tempered, multiple walkers, etc.)  can be
straightforwardly combined with the adaptive path-CV.  Moreover, other
biasing techniques (umbrella sampling, constrained MD, steered MD,
etc.)  can also be used to sample along the path, or even in the
direction perpendicular to it.
 
\subsection masterclass-22-9-model Model system

In this exercise, we will sample the well-known M&uuml;ller-Brown (MB)
potential energy surface (PES).  You can find more about it in Ref. [8].  We
add harmonic walls to limit the sampling within the interesting region
of the PES.

\subsection masterclass-22-9-plumed Using PLUMED

To install PLUMED, if you have not already done this above, go to the
folder `plumed` in the folder for this exercise.  In the script
`install`, change the prefix to the installation folder of your
choice, and then run the script.  If you have issues with the
installation you can check:
<https://plumed.github.io/doc-v2.3/user-doc/html/_installation.html>

To visualize the results of this exercise, plotting script examples
are provided for the [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info) plotting
software (see the script files names starting with `plot_` or
`anim_`).  Make sure to change the corresponding variables according
to your choices of the metadynamics and path-CV parameters. Of course,
feel free to use other plotting tools, for example pythons matplotlib.

* To run the PLUMED pesmd on the MB PES, use the command
`plumed pesmd < path/to/input`.
The `input` file is located in the `Exercise` folder.
Review the PLUMED pesmd documentation:
<https://plumed.github.io/doc-v2.4/user-doc/html/pesmd.html>.
* To perform metadynamics, you can review the keywords on:
<https://plumed.github.io/doc-v2.3/user-doc/html/_m_e_t_a_d.html>. 
* To use the adaptive path-CV, you can review the keywords in the header of the file
`PathCV.cpp` in the folder `plumed` in the folder for
this exercise. To see the html documentation on the path-CV in a
browser, open  <PMD_exercise/plumed/plumed-2.3.0/user-doc/html/_p_a_t_h_c_v.html>
in a browser.
* To construct a FES from the metadynamics hills, use the `plumed sum\_hills`
functionality. Consult its features on:
<https://plumed.github.io/doc-v2.3/user-doc/html/sum_hills.html>.
We recommend to use `--stride` 1 and `--mintozero`.

\subsection masterclass-22-9-exer1 Exercise 1

The first exercise is found in the folder: `masterclass-22-09/exercises/0_md`.

This first exercise is meant to get acquainted with running the
`plumed pesmd` engine, understanding the input files, and plotting the
MD trajectory in the MB potential from the colvar file using gnuplot
(or other plotting software). To use the `./run.me` script to start
the simulation, first make the script executable using:

\verbatim
chmod +x ./run.me
\endverbatim

Use PLUMED pesmd to run regular MD on the MB PES.

What do you observe?

How would you change the behaviour of the system without
 using an enhanced sampling method (just modifying the MD run
 parameters)? 

\subsection masterclass-22-9-exer2 Exercise 2

This exercise is found in the folder:
`masterclass-22-09/exercises/1_metadynamics`.

Before you can run the metadynamics simulation, the `plumed.dat`
should be completed:

\plumedfile
UNITS LENGTH=nm TIME=fs

cv: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2 COMPONENTS

lwall: LOWER_WALLS ARG=cv.x,cv.y AT=-1.5,-0.5 KAPPA=1000.0,1000.0
uwall: UPPER_WALLS ARG=cv.x,cv.y AT=1.5,2.5 KAPPA=1000.0,1000.0

metad: ### ADD YOUR METADYNAMICS INSTRUCTIONS HERE ###

PRINT ARG=cv.x,cv.y,metad.bias STRIDE=100 FILE=colvar.out

Use PLUMED pesmd to run metadynamics on the MB PES.
\endplumedfile

Here are some hints for defining the `METAD` rule:
  - the CVs are here the `DISTANCE` components `cv.x` and `cv.y`, which
 are actually the coordinates of a "2D particle" (with respect to the
 origin) undergoing a Langevin dynamics on the MB PES. Use these
 components as the `ARG` arguments in the `METAD` rule.
  - reasonable widths of the Gaussians (`SIGMA`) are ca. 0.1.
  - 0.1 is also a reasonable Gaussian height
  - a good interval for depositing Gaussians is probably around 500
  - don't forget to define an output `FILE`, that can afterward be
  read using `plumed sum_hills` to generate and plot the free energy
  landscape. 

Try to obtain a good FES reflecting the two minima.

Vary the width of the Gaussians for each CV in a systematic manner,
 what effect do you observe?

Vary the height and deposition frequency of the Gaussians, what trends
 do you observe?

How many crossings and recrossings do you sample in a single run for
 each choice of parameters?


\subsection masterclass-22-9-exer3 Exercise 3

This exercise is found in the folder:
`masterclass-22-09/exercises/2_fixedpathmetadynamics`.

Run metadynamics along a fixed path-CV on the MB PES. We recommend
 using 20 transition nodes, with 20 trailing nodes at each end (60
 nodes in total). Use harmonic walls to keep the sampling within a
 relevant [-0.2,1.2] \f$\sigma\f$-range.

Now there's only one dimension for the Gaussian width, how do you
 interpret it?

Does the diffusion of the system along \f$\sigma\f$ reflect anything
 particular? What could be the reason?

What happens if you add and strengthen a tube potential?

What is the final path and free energy that you obtain?


\subsection masterclass-22-9-exer4 Exercise 4

This exercise is found in the folder:
`masterclass-22-09/exercises/3_adaptivepathmetadynamics`.

First, change the `plumed.dat` input file to make the path adaptive by
changing `PACE`, `STRIDE`, and `HALFLIFE`.

Run metadynamics along an adaptive path-CV on the MB PES. For
 simplification, start with the same pace for the metadynamics
 Gaussians and the path update.

For simplification, you can keep only 20 transition nodes, and not use
 trailing nodes.

Use harmonic walls to keep the sampling within a relevant [-0.2,1.2]
 \f$\sigma\f$-range.

What do you expect if you vary the ratio between the metadynamics and
 the path update frequency?

Vary the tube potential strength and the half-life parameter, what
 trend do you observe?

A small value for the `HALFLIFE` (say 1000 MD steps), keeps the path
flexible so that the path evolves efficiently away from a poor initial
guess path. However, once it has reached the transition channel, it
would be better to set it to a very large value, in order to converge
to the average transition path. Run first a short PMD simulation using
a flexible path and relatively large Gaussians, until the system has
filled both basins and has recrossed back to the initial state. Then,
restart the simulation, using smaller Gaussians and a large
halflife. Use the `INFILE` directive (instead of `GENPATH`) to read
the last updated path, which can be taken from the tail of the
path.out file of the first run.


\subsection masterclass-22-9-exer5 Exercise 5

This exercise is found in the folder:
`masterclass-22-09/exercises/4_multiplewalkers`.

In this final exercise, you will run the parallel "multiple walker"
version of path-metadynamics.

Note that with more walkers building the metadynamics simulation, the
total run time can be shorter, and possibly also the Gaussians can be
smaller.

Try several configurations of walkers and try to answer the question
if there is an optimal number of walkers.
